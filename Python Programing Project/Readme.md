# Project One 

## Project Description and Task

Badmus Kwasi is a student of OneCampus enrolled in the Data Science Program. Badmus belongs to a cohort of over 800 students. 
During the first few bootcamps, Badmus observes the difficulty students in all the cohorts of OneCampus have in knowing their Bootcamp dates and times in their 
local/county time zones. This difficulty often results in students logging in too early, too late, or totally missing their boot camps. Bootcamp times are always 
issued in Eastern Standard Time (EST) which is approximately UTC -5. This is the America -New York time. OneCampus has students in all the time zones of the world.
Badmus wants to develop a PYTHON-ONLY application that can be used to convert Bootcamp times from EST to any of the time zones requested by a student. The app should 
be able to convert the given date and time (Day and Time) to the requested time zone day and time.

## Project Constraints

>- Should be a Python-only application
>- The app should use python containers only e.g. lists, tuple, dictionary etc.
>- The app must not have any database implemented and should not read from nor save to any file on disk.
>- Email script is not necessary

## Application Specifications

>- App should hold information about the times in countries of the world.
>- App should be able to tell the current time in any country specified by the user by simply reading the current system time and time zone.
>- When provided the name of a country and time zone, the app should be able to provide the equivalent time in any specified target country and display its time zone.
>- App should be able to generate the Bootcamp schedule in the time/timezone of any specified target country.
>- As a bonus, the app should be able to read the current system time and alert the user if any upcoming Bootcamp is less than 24 hours from the current system time.
